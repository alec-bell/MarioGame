Warning CA1811: 'GamepadController.CommandRepeated(ICommand,GamePadState)' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: PBI 11 requires the controllers to be able to differentiate between repeated, pressed, and released commands. However
it is possible to satisfy other pbi requirements without using the keyboard events "repeated", "pressed", and "released".

Warning CA1811: 'GamepadReleased.CommandReleased(ICommand,GamePadState)' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: same as the first CA1811 warning

Warning CA1811: 'KeyboardController.CommandReleased(ICommand)' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: same as the first CA1811 warning

Warning CA1811: 'KeyboardController.CommandRepeated(ICommand)' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: same as the first CA1811 warning

Warning CA1030: Consider making 'ItemSpriteFactory.FireFlower(FireFlowerFrame)' an event
justification: Warning is being triggered by method name starting with 'Fire', do not want to change method name to avoid confusion

Warning CA1811: 'playerContext.changeToFalling()' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: PBI 4 calls for a falling action state to be made, but no key is assigned and player movement is not called for in this sprint.
The falling action state will be actively used in a future sprint, but for this sprint all that was needed was the implementation.

Warning CA1823: It appears that field 'FireballCommand.player' is never used or is only ever assigned to. Use this field or remove it
justification: The fireball command is listed as a future command in its PBI's story. It will be called in a future sprint.

Warning CA1823: It appears that field 'PauseCommand.player' is never used or is only ever assigned to. Use this field or remove it
justification: same as above CA1823 warning, but for pause command.

Warning CA1823: It appears that field 'playerContext.returnState' is never used or is only ever assigned to. Use this field or remove it
justification: This field will be used for the star state that will be implemented in a future sprint.

Warning CA1811: 'playerContext.mushroom()' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: Changing power state based on items will be implemented in a future sprint

Warning CA1811: 'playerContext.star()' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: same as above CA1811 warning

Warning CA1811: 'starMario.SmallMario' appears to have no upstream public or protected callers
justification: The Mario star state will be implemented in a future sprint.

Warning CA1822: The 'this' parameter (or 'Me' in Visual Basic) of 'starMario.SmallMario()' is never used. Mark the member as static
(or Shared in Visual Basic) or use 'this'/'Me' in the method body or at least one property accessor, if appropriate
justification: same as above CA1811 warning

Warning CA1014: Mark 'Sprint1.exe' with CLSCompliant(true) because it exposes externally visible types:
Justification: You said in class we didn't have to worry about this.

Warning CA1502: MarioSpriteFactory.Mario(MarioColor, MarioState, MarioFrame)' has a cyclomatic complexity of 95. Rewrite or refactor the
method to reduce complexity to 25. 
Justification: You said in class I didn't have to worry about this because the bodies of the if statements 
all returned the same thing and the cohesion is low.

Warning CA1811 'blockContext.hitFromTopSide(playerContext)' appears to have no upstearm public or protected callers.
Justification: Will be used later for collisions
